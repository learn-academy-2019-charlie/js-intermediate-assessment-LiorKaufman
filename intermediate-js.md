1. What is the difference between .map() and .filter()?
    Both are higher order functions map lets us iterate over each element and apply a function or a change to that element
    filter allows has to remove elements from the array that do not pass a condoitional we set inside of it 

2. Why would you use object destructuring?
 to save time when writing code or accesing the same object/data again and again DRY 
3. What is the difference between var, let, and const?

    the scope for var and const are global. let is a local scope also const does not let us reassign the const variable 
4. Why is testing important?
    
makes us focus on the story/objective 
helps prevent bugs 

5. What is a higher order function?
    a function that takes an other function as the argument 

6. What is the difference between a class and an object?
    a class is a blueprint for objects it allows us to create instances of the class all of the an object with the same attributes but each one has its own instance of the data

### HTML/CSS Review questions: First, try to answer each question on your own then Google the answer to further your knowledge.

1. How do you link a CSS file to your HTML page?
 adding the <style> sheet with the src linked to our css file name 

2. What is the difference between a div and a span?
    a span is inside a text line a div is basicly a box we create inside of the html and put other elements inside of it 
3. What is a CSS class? When should you use an id instead of a class?
    a css class is a way to select and modify the style attributes of every object having the same class name.
    an id is simillar that it let us select all objects with the same id and add css styling to them but ID triumphs class. meaning that if you choose
    an object with both an id and a class whatever you write in the id will overwrite the class

### Stretch: The following questions are potential interview questions. First, try to answer each question on your own then Google the answer to further your knowledge.

1. What is front end development? Can you identify any tools/skills that are uniquely required of front end developers?
    front end development is in charge of the UI there is a requirment to understand the internet and the DOM very well.
    I would say that an eye for design would be useful for a front end developer and the tolls used are react css html and js 

2. What is block scope in JavaScript?
    its a scope thats between 2 curly bracers {<----scope ----->}
3. How would you explain the idea of "inheritance" in object oriented programming?
    A main class extends its data and functions to a child class
for example an animal class with the eat method 
dog extends animal ---> would allow the dog to use the eat method. that we dont have to create a new method specifically for the dog class.
because all dogs are animals and all dogs eat we can just use the method from animal.
